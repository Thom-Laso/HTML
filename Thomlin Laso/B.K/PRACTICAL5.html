<basefont=century size=4 color=blue>
<dl>
	<dt>Cathode Ray Tube(CRT)
	<dd>The CRT works as the same way as a telivision, it contains an electron given at the back of the glass tube. when the electron strike the phosphor dots 
	 they glow to give colours.
	<dt>Lquid Crystal Display(LCD)
	<dd>it is the material used to create each pixel onthe screen. it can paralised light depending on  the electrical chargedacross it. each tiny cell of liquid
	crystal is a pixel.
	<dt>Thin Film Transistor(TFT)
	<dd>it is a device within each pixel that sets the charged. tft is a variant of LCD technology. LCD used much less power than a normal monitor.
	<dt>Plasma Monitors 
	<dd>Plasma Monitors or pdp(Plasma Display Panel)are flat panel display.the plasma technologies utilised small cells containing electrically charged 
	ionized gases across the face of plasma display to form a visual image. plasma monitors are not popular choice as computer monitors because of their 
	expanse weight power consumption and size.
	<font color=green>
	<dt>Touch Screen Monitors(TSM)
	<dd>they are built by combining touch sensitive material with a durable but sensitive outer matirial that  protects the monitors from fingers. it allows the
	monitors to detect where a person is placing his fingers. touch screen displays are used in tablet pcs, checkout store terminals and smart phones.
	</font>
	<dt>organic light emitting display 
	<dd>oled monitors are created from pushing an electric current through organic materials to glow by manipulating the materials and the electric current.
	the glow can be made of desired color. oled displays are extremely thin and light and are portable,light-weight displays.this technologies is new and the 
	price of oled is much more than traditional crt or lcd.
